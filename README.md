<b>Looking for Front-End Web-Developer!</b><br>

The layout is to be build on top of a Control Panel, meaning full integration for all necessary modules of the control panel.<br>

Some of those have unique-look but most have the "generic template".<br>
The layout need to be something unique - something that looks different from those templates//websites mentioned above.<br>
<br>
Template has to have the same amount of information than the above mentioned templates. <br>
<b>The style of the template should be: </b><br>
- Simple-looking <br>
- Minimal <br>
- Calm-coloured <br>
- Polished <br>
- Sophisticated<br>
Something that tells the visitor immediatelly that this is a work of a professional, not just another generic template. <br>
I had a Wizard-level developer but he is too busy. He wasn't able to finish his vision of the design: <a href="https://imgur.com/a/t6gLU"> https://imgur.com/a/t6gLU</a> <br>
<br>
<b>Required in the frontpage:<br></b>
- Logo<br>
- Server status (Char, Map and Login -servers, Online/Offline)<br>
- Players Online (Very important!)<br>
- Episode info (13.2)<br>
- Rate info (5x/5x/3x)<br>
- Play Now -button (Very important! needs to be big and clear and attractive)<br>
- Review Us -button 
- Menu links (example: Info, Rules, Download, Staff, About, Contact us, Forum, something,something..)<br>
- Facebook, Discord, Twitter Youtube -links/buttons<br>
- Small and cute area for "Download", "Register" and "Login" in top of the page<br>
- Server Time - format: "15:09:42 (CET)"<br>
- WoE Schedule - when is the WoE-event(s), format: "Sat 18:00 & Sun 21:00"<br>
- WoE On/Off - is the WoE currently active?<br>
- WoE Countdown clock - how long until next woe starts?<br>
Additional stuff, required to be shown on frontpage, preferably in "Three big boxes": <br>
1. "Media of the month", usually some kind of a screenshot, sometimes a vid or gif.<br>
2. Top-chart, either Top PvP-players or Top Guilds<br>
3. Latest News, shows the latest news, that are posted in forums by admins, like patch notes, events etc<br>

<br>
<b>What is NOT wanted:</b><br>
- Dark coloured theme <br>
- Too much distractions <br>
- Scrolling website (parallax feels stupid for this thing) <br>
- A person who don't understand english <br>
<br>
<b>This project is not in a rush, and it won't start before March 2018</b><br>
Completion of the server is expected during this year, 2018.<br>
After the completion of the website, if the job goes well, there is definitely more work promised, although not as big as this.
